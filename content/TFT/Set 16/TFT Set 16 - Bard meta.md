> [!info] Caretaker
> After winning player combat, gain a random unit from Runeterra. After losing combat, gain free rerolls, with the amount increasing by stage. 

Take an Economy augment and roll for Bard more than 80% of your games.

Why? The rerolls on losses more than make up for the early economy you lose, especially in stage 4. Greed and stack Bard rolls until you finish your level 8 or are at 2 lives remaining.

Works in every comp, but here are some specific examples below.

# Caitlyn 3 T-Hex
Bard often summons a Caitlyn when you win and rolls help you star up units to unlock T-Hex.
Greed Bard until 2 lives and swap out him and 6 Piltover for legendaries.

# Draven Skarner fast 9
Use free Bard rolls to hit Draven 2 on 3-5 level 7 and greed Bard further to hit 4 cost upgrades and go 9 and swap to Kindred carry.

# Diana Shurima
Use bard rolls to hit Leona 2 and then greed him and stack rolls in stage 4 to complete board.

You seriously can play him towards any comp with an econ augment or high econ start.

The units you roll for on stage 2 with bard is usually Econ Ionia, 3 Ixtal, 3 Bilgewater, or tempo.

If low hp roll on 3-5, if high HP can roll lvl 8.
