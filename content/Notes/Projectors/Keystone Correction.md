When a projector is placed at an angle to the screen, the projected image becomes distorted into a trapezoid shape instead of a rectangle.
This distortion is called **keystone effect**.

**Keystone correction** is the method of adjusting the image so it appears rectangular again.  

There are several types of keystone correction.

## Types of Keystone Correction

### Vertical Keystone

Vertical keystone correction fixes distortion when the projector is too high (ceiling mounted) or too low (table placement) relative to the screen.

### Horizontal Keystone

Horizontal keystone correction fixes distortion when the projector is placed to the left or right of the screen’s center.

### 4-Point (Corner) Keystone

4-point keystone allows adjustment of each corner of the image independently. This makes it possible to correct both vertical and horizontal distortions at once and adapt to uneven projection surfaces.

### Auto Keystone

Auto keystone uses sensors to detect the angle of the projector and automatically corrects the distortion.

### [[Lens-shift function|Lens Shift]] (Optical Alternative)

[[Lens-shift function|Lens shift]] is not digital correction but a mechanical adjustment that moves the lens up/down or left/right to align the image.
Because it is optical, there is no scaling and no loss in image quality. It is available mainly in higher-end projectors.
