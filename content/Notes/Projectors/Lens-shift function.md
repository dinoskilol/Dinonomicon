**Lens shift** is a mechanical adjustment in a projector that moves the lens inside the projector housing. By shifting the lens up, down, left, or right, the image position on the screen can be changed without tilting the projector and without introducing trapezoid distortion.  

Unlike digital [[Keystone correction|keystone correction]], lens shift preserves the full resolution and image quality because no digital scaling is applied.

## Types of Lens Shift

### Vertical Lens Shift

Vertical lens shift moves the image up or down on the screen.

### Horizontal Lens Shift

Horizontal lens shift moves the image left or right. Usually offers a smaller adjustment range than vertical shift.

### Combined (Vertical + Horizontal)

Some projectors provide both vertical and horizontal lens shift. This combination gives maximum flexibility, allowing placement above, below, or to the side of screen center without compromising image quality.
