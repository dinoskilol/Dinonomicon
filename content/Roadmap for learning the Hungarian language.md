As some of you might know, my girlfriend is Hungarian. As a pet project of mine, I wish to learn Hungarian in order to not only learn more about the culture of my loved one, but also to conversate with her family more easily. Also, it will help me when I go visit Budapest again.

Learning a language unfortunately is not that easy though. In my opinion, apps like Duolingo don't really help as much as they're advertised to. For this reason, we are going to take a slightly different approach. While I learned English and German simply by being exposed to the languages, and Italian because it is my native tongue, for Hungarian we will use multiple tools.

First, research has pointed me to many different resources.

# Resources

- [Hungarian Alphabet with Pronunciation](https://www.catchbudapest.com/hungarian-alphabet/)
- [Videos for Consonants, Vowels and Spelling Rules](https://www.catchbudapest.com/how-to-learn-hungarian/#3-2)
- [Hungarian Numbers](https://www.catchbudapest.com/hungarian-numbers/)

These will be the three primary initial resources we will use in order to build strong fundamentals. They are all taken from this [article](https://www.catchbudapest.com/how-to-learn-hungarian/) on how to learn Hungarian.

We will combine videos with any AI capable of watching them in order to transcribe everything that has been said.
Our primary AI used will be ChatGPT, with the creation of a Project just for learning Hungarian.

In order to properly understand the pronunciation of the words, the LLM will be used in order to write a phonetical spelling as it would be said in Italian.

# Roadmap, Step by Step
