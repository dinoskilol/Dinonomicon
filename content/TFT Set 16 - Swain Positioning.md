Swain is one of the most splashable units of this set, be it for his traits (Arcanist giving AP to the entire board, Juggernaut makes him more reliably durable and Noxus can be a good addition, especially with Bronze for Life) or for its AoE CC.

Let us look at his ability: he summons his eye within 2 hexes. The eye is the center of the stun and targets the largest clump of champions in a 3 hex radius.

# Playing Swain

Swain can be defaulted in the middle as he can reach both corners, rendering it an easy way to catch opponents who have not prepared against it.

# Playing against Swain

If the enemy has prepared for it, they can avoid Swain’s stun no matter what. Against Swain, all you have to do is make sure your ranged carry is not in the largest clump of champions on the board.
