**Throw correction** refers to a projector’s ability to adjust the image size and placement relative to the distance between the projector and the screen, without having to physically move the projector.

It is closely related to the concept of **throw ratio**, which defines how wide the image will be at a given distance.  

Throw correction is usually achieved with a **zoom lens** or variable optics that allow users to fine-tune the image size. Some projectors are designed with **short throw** or **ultra-short throw** lenses to project large images from very close distances. The flexibility of throw correction directly affects installation options in different environments.

## Types of Throw Correction

### Optical Zoom (Variable Throw)

An optical zoom lens allows the image size to be increased or decreased by adjusting the lens, without moving the projector. The zoom range is expressed as a ratio (e.g. 1.2x, 1.6x).

### Fixed Throw (No Zoom)

Some projectors, especially budget models and portable units, have a fixed throw ratio with no zoom adjustment. The only way to change image size is by moving the projector closer or farther from the screen.

### Short Throw

Short throw projectors have specially designed lenses that project large images from a short distance (e.g. 100-inch image from 1–2 meters).

### Ultra-Short Throw (UST)

Ultra-short throw projectors can sit just a few centimeters from the wall or screen and still project very large images.
