## Flare

<i>Flare</i>, also known as <i>Nuke</i>, is considered an ultimate spell in some of the games (along with Holy, Meteor and Ultima). It can be a non-elemental Black Magic or the final form of the Fire magic.

- deca – 10<sup>1</sup> – 10
- kilo – 10<sup>3</sup> – 1,000
- **mega** – 10<sup>6</sup> – 1,000,000

## Megaflare

<i>Megaflare</i>, performed by Bahamut in Final Fantasy XIII. Also known as <i>Mega Flare</i>, <i>Sun Flare</i> and <i>MegaNuke</i>, and it is usually used by Bahamut - sometimes other versions of it, with different prefixes (<i>Dark Flare</i> by Tiamat).

- **giga** – 10<sup>9</sup> – 1,000,000,000

## Gigaflare

<i>Gigaflare</i> is an upgraded form of Megaflare and just like it, is most often used by Bahamut or very strong bosses.

- **tera** – 10<sup>12</sup> – 1,000,000,000,000

## Teraflare

<i>Teraflare</i>, also spelled <i>Tera Flare</i>, is an upgraded form of Megaflare even stronger than Gigaflare, and it does colossal non-elemental damage to all targets. It is universally exclusive to Bahamut and incarnations of his, and was the spell used in the ending of FF XIV.

- peta – 10<sup>15</sup> – 1,000,000,000,000,000
- **exa** – 10<sup>18 </sup>– 1,000,000,000,000,000,000

## Exaflare

![[Flares and Bahamut's Pinnacle-20250319093524484.png]]

<i>Exaflare</i> is an ability associated with variants of Bahamut, but not Bahamut himself. Based on the spell's name etymology, one can expect it to be stronger than Teraflare.

- **zetta** -10<sup>21</sup> – 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
## Zettaflare

<i>Zettaflare</i> stands at the pinnacle of abilities not only in **Final Fantasy**, but the entire Square Enix multiverse.

Let us put this into perspective. “Teraflare” is what Bahamut used to wipe out the original FF14 universe and “Zettaflare” trascends that benchmark by two tiers.

An actual canon estimation of the strength of this spell is one QUADRILLION times “Teraflare”'s power.

This is the most destructive spell in the franchise, capable of wiping out entire universes.

It is so powerful that it cannot be used under normal circumstances and prior to this game (Final Fantasy XVI), there have only ever been two characters in all of Square Enix who were able to cast it, making it extremely limited.

The first one was Airy from Bravely Default who could only use it after being powered up by an Eldritch God who, at that point, had already devoured several thousand alternate universes to obtain that level of power.

The second was Donald Duck from Kingdom Hearts 3, making Bahamut the official third.

Here in Bahamut’s case, he used it only after absorbing a crystal that has been storing several thousand years worth of aether in it. Donald is the only exception to the special circumstances requisite.

The spell has existed in the the series for a while now but was treated like an myth, something nobody thought possible to achieve until now. The fact that this is the first time it’s been ever been used in Final Fantasy is outstanding.
