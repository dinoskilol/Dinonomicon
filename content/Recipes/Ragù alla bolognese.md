One of the simplest, most flavourful ragù you can make.
Preferred pasta to use is <b>tagliatelle</b>, but <b>spaghetti</b> is what made it so commonly known internationally.

## Recipe
> [!INFO]+ Ingredients
> - Olive oil<br>
> - 150g of bacon<br>
> - 300g of minced beef<br>
> - 300g of passata di pomodoro<br>
> - Celery<br>
> - Onion<br>
> - Carrot<br>
> - Red wine<br>
> - 1l vegetable broth<br>
> **Optional:** Dark chocolate

Pour olive oil in a big pot on high heat. Drop the cubed bacon in, after a few minutes drop the chopped celery, onion and carrot in and let it brown. After a few minutes again, drop the minced beef.

Scorch, then deglaze using wine.

The color of the ragù should be brown, not red. 
After that, pour all of the passata di pomodoro and start cooking for 2 hours on low-medium heat, while constantly checking how much liquid is inside and refilling with a ladle of vegetable broth around every 20 minutes.
You can optionally add dark chocolate to make the flavour profile richer and add a slight bit of creaminess.

When sauce has thickened, taste: if necessary, add a glass of milk, then salt and pepper.
