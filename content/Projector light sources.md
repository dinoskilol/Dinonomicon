Projector light sources fall into two broad families: traditional lamp-based sources and solid-state sources.

Lamp-based sources use a replaceable bulb that produces light through electric discharge in a gas and metal salts.

Solid-state sources use semiconductor devices such as LEDs or lasers to create light without a conventional bulb.

## Types of light sources

### Lamp-based

Lamp-based projectors typically require a warm-up period to reach stable brightness and they lose brightness gradually as the lamp ages. Lamps have a limited rated life, often between 2,000 and 5,000 hours in average consumer and business models, and sometimes more with eco modes. Lamp replacement is a recurring maintenance cost and proper disposal is necessary because some lamps contain mercury or other hazardous materials.

Lamp-based systems are the oldest and were the standard for many years. The common variants are **Ultra High Performance** (UHP) lamps, **metal halide**, and **xenon arc lamps**.

UHP and metal halide lamps deliver high peak brightness and have been widely used in consumer, education, and business projectors.

Xenon arc lamps, which are rarer in small projectors, have been common in cinema projectors and in specialized high-color-accuracy applications.

### LED

LED projectors use arrays of high-power LEDs as the light source. LEDs provide very long operating life compared to lamps and maintain color stability over time. They reach usable brightness instantly and support instant on/off operation without warm-up. LED-based projectors are compact and energy efficient, and they produce less heat.

The main limitation for LED projectors has historically been maximum brightness. Consumer and portable LED projectors are excellent for small- to medium-size screens and for dark to moderately lit rooms, but they struggle in very bright environments unless paired with a smaller screen or very close throw distances. LEDs typically advertise lifespans in the tens of thousands of hours, commonly 20,000 to 30,000 hours for many models.

### Laser

Laser sources are solid-state, with long rated lifetimes often quoted in the tens of thousands of hours, and they provide near-instant on/off capability, minimal drift in color and brightness, and lower maintenance because there is no replaceable bulb. Lasers can achieve much higher lumen outputs than LED, making them ideal for bright-room and large-screen applications.

Laser projectors come in multiple flavors:

#### Direct RGB laser

RGB laser projectors use separate red, green, and blue laser emitters to generate light directly. These systems offer the best color gamut and can reach very high brightness.

#### Blue laser with phosphor

Blue-laser plus phosphor systems use blue lasers to excite a phosphor wheel that emits yellow light which, combined with the remaining blue, creates full-color images. This approach scales well to very high brightness levels and is common in large venue and cinema-class projectors.

#### Laser-phosphor

Laser-phosphor is technically a hybrid in the sense that a laser pumps a phosphor to create broad-spectrum white light that is then used by the projector engine.
